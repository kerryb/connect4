# Connect 4 Tournament Server

A server to run a coding contest based around the game of [Connect
4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four).

The idea is that developers/pairs/teams sign up on the site, are given a unique
URL, then compete in a tournament against each other by writing programs that
interface with a simple HTTP API.

## Standard Phoenix Stuff

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
